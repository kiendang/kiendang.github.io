I am currently a PhD Student working on machine learning in healthcare with a focus on critical care at Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore under Dr Mengling 'Mornin' Feng. My interests include representation learning, functional programming and open source software. Check out my code on [Github](https://github.com/kiendang) and my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=MGpmdtgAAAAJ).
